-CssTealTransition WHAT TO PUT WHERE:
My days are spent creating niche websites and solutions for small business owners and creatives.

            <!-- <p>
            most clients just want something better than what they have.
            Usually, clients have specific goals or problems they want to solve…
            and typically one polished design does that for them (if you
            actually listen during discovery). Clients come to us for our
            expertise. They want someone to lead them, and tell them what’s
            best. What will solve their issues, help them meet their goals, and
            why. If you can explain the reasoning behind your design decisions
            and how it solves the problems they are having, most times they will
            trust you. When clients have to pick, it silently communicates that
            they are the experts and they know best, which ultimately leads to
            them micromanaging.  It also sets up a situation where if the new
            design isn’t performing well, they second-guess the design they
            chose. So, with all of that said… own your work, and be the expert
            they’re hiring you to be! Give one design, and iterate as needed.

            translated into vivid, handcrafted websites.

            Unique Selling Point: You're not just designing websites—you’re
            co-creating digital homes for passionate people. You get their
            creative process because you share it.

NOTE: the “Canvas & Code” concept—positioning web design as a collaborative,
artistic process tailored specifically for creatives—is relatively niche
and underused.

That said, a handful of designers do operate in adjacent spaces (e.g.,
studio brands targeting indie artists or feminine brands), but your unique
blend of handmade feel + custom digital artistry gives you a strong point
of differentiation.

  CURRENT NOTES: ON ‘CREATE YOUR OFFER’ VID

find your niche-”LC- target demand would be rich artists in the area, think of 60-year-old high deserter who has no time or patience for websites”

free value blog: tech assistance to senior citizens.??

-”reason not to work for free: a customer who pays is more invested in the business project, as opposed to a free customer”

- KEY MINDSHIFT SHIFTS:
- avoid the “too many options on the menu, also betraying yourself as the budget option”

- two types of clients: one who wants a dance monkey, or one who are happy to pay expert prices for long standing results”

- ”your brand isn’t built alone in your bedroom, but through collaboration with your audience.”

??make the first 1/2 of website a different color scheme than the second half. Both halves should blend into the other ??maybe opposite color schemes?

- Save case studies for EH

- I THINK ARTICLES SHOULD BE DISPLAYED AFTER CONTENT READY. LETS STICK WITH PGS:
